MySQL client port driver. Uses libmysqlclient, as opposed to sniffing
wire protocol.

Spawns one unix process per DB connection. This process has a knack
for exiting when anything goes even slighltly amiss. It also gets
restarted by a supervisor, so this might be a good thing.

This library tries to be ODBC compatible as much as possible. I have
never actually /used/ ODBC, but I can read man pages. If you know
better, please let me know.

My objective is that if you know how to use ODBC in Erlang, then you
can use this library with only changing the connect syntax.
